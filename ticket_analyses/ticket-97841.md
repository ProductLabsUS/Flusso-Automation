Hi Team,
Quick question from Lisa at Naples Plumbing Studio regarding our pressure balance valves PBV1005 and PBV2105.
If a customer orders the 2-outlet valve, can they upgrade to a 3-outlet later by changing the diverter cartridge or is it a completely different valve body?
Please advise.
Best,

Product Specifications and Features for PBV1005A (2-Way Diverter Valve)**\n\nThe PBV1005A is a Pressure Balance Valve with an integrated 2-Way Diverter.\n\n*   **Functionality:** It features a lift handle to control water volume, with turning left for hot water and right for cold water. A small knob controls the 2-way water diversion, which includes a shared output.\n*   **Flow Rate:** The pressure balance valve has a flow rate of 5.5 GPM (Gallons Per Minute) at 60 PSI.\n*   **Standards:** It complies with ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1 and cUPC standards.\n*   **Water Diversion Diagram:** The diverter has three positions: Left, Middle (Shared Flow is Low Transition Flow), and Right.\n*   **Extension:** An extension, PBV.2100E**, is available for this valve.\n*   **Critical Dimensions:** Detailed technical diagrams with critical dimensions in millimeters and inches are available in the specification sheets. For example, the valve body has dimensions such as 160mm [6.28in] width and 178mm [7.00in] height.\n\n**2. Product Specifications and Features for PBV.2105 (3-Output Diverter Valve)**\n\nThe PBV.2105 is a Pressure Balance valve with an integrated 3-output diverter.\n\n*   **Connections:** It features ½” NPT male connections, with two inputs for hot/cold water and three output ports.\n*   **Flow Rate:** The valve has a flow rate of 5.5 GPM at 60 PSI.\n*   **Supply Stops:** Two safety stops are included at each water inlet to prevent water flow during installation or repairs.\n*   **Handle Operation:**\n    *   The lower handle controls both water volume and temperature. Lifting the handle controls volume, while moving it left provides hot water and right provides cold water.\n    *   The diverter handle, located on the top, directs the water flow among the three output ports of the valve.\n*   **Cut Out Dimensions:** The recommended wall cut-out dimensions are 5.43” x 4.76” Inches to ensure proper coverage by the trim plate.\n*   **Trims:** The trim set for the PBV.2105 includes a trim plate and handle knobs for both the top (diverter) and bottom (volume/temperature) cartridges.\n*   **Extension:** An extension, PBV.2100E**, is also available for this valve.\n\n**3. Diverter Cartridge Upgrade and Parts Information**\n\nWhile the documents describe the functionality and trim components, specific part numbers for the internal diverter *cartridges* for upgrade or replacement are not explicitly listed in the provided specification sheets.\n\nHowever, the following external diverter handle parts are mentioned for the PBV1005A:\n*   Diverter Handle - 160.PBV.DIVCP-Chrome\n*   Diverter Handle - 160.PBV.DIVBN-Brushed Nickel\n\nFor the PBV.2105, the trim set includes handle knobs for both the top and bottom cartridges, but the internal cartridge part numbers are not detailed.\n\nTo obtain specific part numbers for the internal diverter cartridges (for PBV1005A and PBV.2105) or detailed upgrade instructions, further documentation such as a dedicated parts list or service manual would be required.","source_documents":[{"uri":null,"rank":1,"title":"100.3200-Spec-Sheet.pdf","source_type":"gemini_file_search","content_preview":"only valve not included\n\n• Lift Handle to control volume.

Pressure Balance Valve with Integrated 3-Output Diverter (PBV.2105)**\n\n*   **Description:** This valve features brass construction and an integrated 3-way diverter. It has 1/2\" NPT male connections with two inputs for hot/cold water and three output ports. The flow rate is 5.5 GPM at 60 PSI.\n*   **Handle Operation:** The lower handle controls water volume and temperature (lift for volume, move left for hot, right for cold). The top diverter handle directs flow to the three outputs.\n*   **Supply Stops:** Two safety stops are located at each water inlet for installation and repair purposes.\n*   **Cut Out Dimensions:** The recommended wall cut-out dimensions are 5.43” x 4.76” to ensure proper coverage by the trim plate.\n*   **Trims:** The trim set for PBV.2105 includes a trim plate and handle knobs for both the top and bottom cartridges. Any *2100T, *2101T, or *2102T series trim can be used with this valve. Extension kits for handles are available separately if needed.\n*   **Extension Available:** PBV.2100E**\n*   **Documentation:**\n    *   Spec Sheet: PBV.2105-Spec-Sheet.pdf\n    *   Installation Manual: PBV.2105-Installation-Manual.pdf\n\n**2. Pressure Balance Valve with Integrated 2-Way Diverter (PBV1005A)**\n\n*   **Description:** This valve also features solid brass construction and an integrated 2-way diverter. It has 1/2\" NPT male connections with two inputs for hot/cold water and two output ports. The flow rate is 5.5 GPM at 60 PSI.\n*   **Handle Operation:** The lower handle controls water volume and temperature (lift for volume, turn left for hot, right for cold). A small knob controls the 2-way water diversion, including a shared output option.\n*   **Supply Stops:** Similar to the 3-output valve, there are two safety stops at each water inlet.\n*   **Extension Available:** PBV.2100E**\n*   **Documentation:**\n    *   Spec Sheet: PBV1005A_253.pdf\n\n**Key Considerations for Upgrade:**\n\n*   **Output Requirements:** Determine if the customer needs a 2-output or 3-output diverter based on their shower system configuration (e.g., showerhead, handheld, body jets, tub spout).\n*   **Compatibility:** The documentation indicates that specific trim series (*2100T, *2101T, or *2102T) are compatible with the PBV.2105 valve. Ensure any new trim components are compatible with the chosen valve body.\n*   **Cut-out Dimensions:** Verify that the existing wall cut-out or planned new cut-out will accommodate the dimensions of the chosen valve body and trim plate.\n*   **Extension Kits:** If the handles need to be extended for proper fit with the trim, extension kits (PBV.2100E**) are available.\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, refer to the specific installation manuals for the PBV.2105 and PBV1005A valves.","source_documents":[{"uri":null,"rank":1,"title":"etc02o7dwyju","source_type":"gemini_file_search","content_preview":"Brass Construction,Integrated 3-Way Diverter,\"1/2\"\" NPT Male Connections\",Extension Available - PBV.2100E**,,,,7.25,7.05,6.75,\"The PBV.2105 – Pressure Balance valve with integrated 3-output diverter has a ½” NPT male connection with two inputs for hot/cold water and three output ports.

This valve controls water volume and temperature with a lift handle, and a small knob manages the 2-way water diversion, which includes a shared output option.\n\nHere is the product-specific documentation for the PBV1005A, focusing on the diverter cartridge and related components:\n\n**1. Diverter Cartridge Information and Parts List:**\nThe product parts breakdown for the PBV1005A identifies the following diverter cartridges and related components:\n*   **Diverter Cartridge (Non-Shared):** PBV1005A-1991\n*   **Diverter Cartridge (Shared):** PBV1005A-1991-G1\n*   **Obsolete Diverter Cartridge:** PBV1005A-1991 (listed under \"Product Parts Breakdown (Obsolete)\")\n*   **Diverter Cover:** 6032029-383A\n*   **Diverter Retaining Nut:** 1096011-062\n\nOther relevant parts include:\n*   **Pressure Balance Cartridge (Blue):** PBV1005A-9853\n*   **Pressure Balance Cartridge (Yellow):** PBV1005A-9400\n*   **Integral Stop Kit:** PBV1005AS-1987\n\n**2. Technical Specifications:**\nThe PBV1005A is a pressure balance valve with an integrated 2-way diverter.\n*   **Flow Rate:** 5.5 GPM (Gallons Per Minute) at 60 PSI.\n*   **Water Diversion:** The small knob controls 2-way water diversion, offering a shared output.\n    *   **Diverter Position = Left:** Activates one output.\n    *   **Diverter Position = Middle:** Provides shared flow, which is a low transition flow.\n    *   **Diverter Position = Right:** Activates the other output.\n*   **Extension Available:** PBV.2100E** (finish needs to be specified).\n*   **Standards:** Complies with ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1 and is UPC/cUPC certified.\n\n**3. Installation and Dimensions:**\n*   **Handle Operation:** The lower handle controls water volume and temperature (lift for volume, left for hot, right for cold). The top diverter handle directs water flow between the two outputs of the valve. When the diverter handle points left, water flows through the lower output; when it points right, the top output is activated.\n*   **Cut Out Dimensions:** The recommended wall cut-out for installation is 5.43” x 4.76” Inches to ensure proper coverage by the trim plate.\n*   **Critical Dimensions:** Technical diagrams provide critical dimensions in millimeters and inches. For example, the valve body has dimensions such as 160 mm [6.28 in] width and 178 mm [7.00 in] height.\n\n**Note on 2-outlet vs. 3-outlet:**\nThe documentation consistently describes the PBV1005A as having an \"integrated 2-way diverter\" and refers to \"two outputs\" for water flow. There is no mention of a 3-outlet valve body for the PBV1005 model in the provided documents.","source_documents":[{"uri":null,"rank":1,"title":"100.3200-Spec-Sheet.pdf","source_type":"gemini_file_search","content_preview":"only valve not included\n\n• Lift Handle to control volume.

It is designed to control both water volume and temperature, as well as divert water flow between two outputs. The documentation consistently refers to a 2-way diverter system for this model, with no mention of a 3-outlet diverter cartridge or valve body.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the available documentation for the PBV1005A:\n\n**Product Specifications and Features:**\n*   **Model:** PBV1005A | Pressure Balance Valve With Integrated 2-Way Diverter\n*   **Flow Rate:** The pressure balance valve has a flow rate of 5.5 GPM (Gallons Per Minute) at 60 PSI.\n*   **Standards:** It complies with ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1 and cUPC standards.\n*   **Handle Operation:**\n    *   The lower handle controls volume and temperature. Lifting the handle controls volume, and moving it left provides hot water, while moving it right provides cold water.\n    *   The top diverter handle directs water flow between the two outputs. When the diverter handle points left, water flows through the lower output. When it points right, the top output is activated.\n    *   The knob controls 2-way water diversion, with a shared output option.\n*   **Water Diversion:** The diverter has three positions: Left, Middle (Shared Flow is Low Transition Flow), and Right.\n*   **Extension:** An extension (PBV.2100E**) is available for the valve.\n\n**Parts Breakdown:**\nThe PBV1005A includes the following key components:\n*   **Diverter Cartridge:**\n    *   PBV1005A-1991 - Non-Shared\n    *   PBV1005A-1991-G1 - Shared\n    *   An obsolete version, PBV1005A-1991, is also listed.\n*   **Pressure Balance Cartridge:**\n    *   PBV1005A-9853 (Blue)\n    *   PBV1005A-9400 (Yellow)\n*   **Other Components:**\n    *   Threaded Connector: 8002048-122\n    *   Diverter Cover: 6032029-383A (or 6032029-383 for obsolete version)\n    *   Diverter Retaining Nut: 1096011-062\n    *   Cartridge Cover A: 8002048-045 (or 8002048-042 for obsolete version)\n    *   Retaining Nut: PBV1005A-9852\n    *   Cartridge Bezel A: 8002048-072\n    *   Cartridge Retainer: 8002048-044\n    *   Integral Stop Kit: PBV1005AS-1987\n\n**Installation Information:**\n*   **Cut Out Dimensions:** The recommended cut-out in the wall should be 5.43” x 4.76” inches to ensure proper coverage by the trim plate.\n*   **Trims:** The trim set for PBV1005A includes a trim plate and handle knobs for both the top and bottom cartridges. Extension kits for the handles can be ordered separately if needed for proper fit.\n\n**Difference between 2-outlet and 3-outlet diverter cartridge valve body and upgrade:**\nThe documentation for the PBV1005A consistently describes it as having an \"Integrated 2-Way Diverter\" with shared output capabilities. The parts breakdown lists diverter cartridges for \"Non-Shared\" and \"Shared\" flow, both within the context of a 2-way diversion system. There is no information provided in the available documents regarding a 3-outlet diverter cartridge or valve body for the PBV1005A, nor are there any instructions or parts for upgrading this specific model to a 3-outlet configuration.

summary : 
Executive Summary of Failure
The workflow failed because the AI "hallucinated" that it was missing information, despite having the correct answer in its search results.

Instead of answering the customer's technical question, the AI sent a generic "Please provide your model number" response—even though the customer had already provided the model numbers (PBV1005, PBV2105) in their first message.

Root Cause Analysis
1. Inference Failure (The "Evidence Resolver" Bug) The AI successfully retrieved documents showing that the PBV1005 is a 2-outlet valve body and the PBV2105 is a 3-outlet valve body.

The Failure: The AI's logic engine refused to infer that "different physical bodies" means "you cannot just swap a cartridge."

The Consequence: Because it didn't find a document literally saying "You cannot upgrade this," it marked the evidence as "insufficient" (Confidence: 0.2) and defaulted to asking the customer for more info.

2. Loop Inefficiency The agent got stuck in a repetitive loop (13 iterations), searching for the same model numbers over and over again because it refused to accept the technical specifications it had already found as a valid answer.

Recommended Fix
Adjust the "Evidence Resolver" Logic: The system needs to be tuned to accept technical specifications (e.g., port counts, valve body dimensions) as valid evidence for compatibility questions, rather than waiting for an explicit "FAQ style" answer.
